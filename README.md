📊 Loan Analytics Dashboard using Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing loan application and performance data using Microsoft Power BI to derive actionable insights related to loan approvals, defaults, customer risk, and portfolio health. The dashboard transforms raw loan data into meaningful visual insights that support data-driven decision-making in the financial domain.

The project demonstrates the complete business intelligence lifecycle, including data preprocessing, modeling, KPI creation, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze overall loan portfolio performance

Understand loan approval, rejection, and default patterns

Identify high-risk and high-value customer segments

Study the impact of income, credit score, and loan attributes on loan outcomes

Build an interactive and executive-friendly Power BI dashboard

🗂️ Dataset Information

Source: Publicly available loan dataset (open-data platforms such as Kaggle)
